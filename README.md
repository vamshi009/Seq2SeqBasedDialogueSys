# Seq2SeqBasedDialogueSys
The project is just for learning purpose and no copyrights owned!

The project uses the model demonstarted from pytorch examples https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html

The model is tuned to work for the dialogue conversations data from Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus!

It can be seen as a sample version of a End-to-End Dialogue System!! 

Happy Coding :D
